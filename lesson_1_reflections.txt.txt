 comparing files usign fc or diff, in case of Windows and OSX respectively is very useful for the purposes of this course and many others

 How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
 first of all, to see how much and how long it takes to think and write the code
 secondally to see how many improvement you made until the actual version
 and third to work "safely" in a newer version knowing you have the option to go back looking for a previous version and restore it.
