	How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It help me to see where exactly was introduced the bug and let me save time instead of just looking by
	myself the whole archive

	How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	 To see the initiation of a program and also for being able to remember what was the main porpouse of 
	 the software you created

	 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	 Pros
	 You have the total control over the project
	 You decided if for some reason yo don't want to commit or save something

	 Cons
	 You can easily forget to commit or save something important
	 Have to practice constantly when is ideal to commit
